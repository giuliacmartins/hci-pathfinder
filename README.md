Redesigned the interface of the old Pathfinder wiki website
Used HTML and CSS for the appearance of the interface, Javascript to connect to the database, and MySQL to hold the spell data and images. 

This updated Pathfinder interface gives a more positive user experience when it comes to locating Pathfinder spells. The old Pathfinder wiki was too cluttered and most users that played the game say that it can be confusing. So, the purpose of this website is to create a new interface that is simple and not cluttered to for the user. 

***INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION ARE WITHIN THIS ZIP FILE***

***NOTE: We utilized obtaining the spells into a database. We used MySQL to hold our necessary data and to run the application with the data (sql file is in this zip) follow what is mentioned below***

1. Make sure you have the application running first in the 'client' folder. 
2. Make sure to have MySQL in your system to import the SQL file
3. Update the password from the 'index.js' file based on the password you have for your local host 
3. Open a new terminal and direct it to the 'server' folder
4. Then run node index.js. 'Yay!!!' is your indicator that you have connected to the data.
