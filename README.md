USF Human-Computer Interaction Semester Long Project
Code written by Molina Hoy and Giulia Martins

Redesigned the interface of the old Pathfinder wiki website
Used HTML and CSS for the appearance of the interface, Javascript to connect to the database, and MySQL to old the spell data and images. 

This updated Pathfinder interface gives a more positive user experience when it comes to locating Pathfinder spells. The old Pathfinder wiki was too cluttered and most users that played the game say that is can be confusing. So, the purpose for this website is to create a new interface that is simple and not cluttered to for the user.
